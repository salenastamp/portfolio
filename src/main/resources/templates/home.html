			<p class="home">Hello! I'm Salena and I'm a Junior Developer based in Charlotte, NC. My work specializes in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, Springboot, and SQL. Please look around to learn more.</p>
			<p class="home">In case you're just not ready to navigate, here are a few stories about why you should hire me.</p>
			<p class="home">I once had a boss who said that his favorite thing about me was that once he gave me a project, he would never have to think about it again because I always took care of things.</p>
			<p class="home">I had another boss whose favorite thing about me was that I always brought a proposed solution to her along with any problems.</p>
			<p class="home">In my coding bootcamp, I worked regularly with a very talented group of other students. In our projects together, we would often spend hours on Zoom trying to find a solution to a problem, only to decide it was time to set it aside for the day when we were well and truly stuck. 
			They started to laugh because every time we would do that, shortly after they hung up, I just couldn't let it go. I kept at it, and I usually solved the problem on my own within an hour or so. I simply couldn't stop trying to find the answer until the puzzle was solved.</p>
