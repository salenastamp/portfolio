					<p>Salena is a junior front-end web and Java developer with a unique background as a dancer, choreographer, and arts administrator. </p>
					
					<p>She is using her new skills for web development and her long-term talents for collaboration, combined with a passion for delivering a great experience to make websites that will wow.</p>
					<p>You may be wondering how she made the great leap from dancing to development. 
					During six years working in administration at Blumenthal Performing Arts, she found that her favorite parts of her job were using complex Excel formulas and macros to make spreadsheets that automated tasks and made work easier for her and her colleagues. 
					Upon the arrival of COVID-19, she realized it was time for a new career and knew that her passion for nested if functions would translate to a passion for coding. 
					And a new career was born!</p>
